# Secure Messaging System
 Like Facebook Messenger, end to end and data at rest encryption was the goal of this C# based project. Having X number of client applications sending data to a server application and the server transferring the data to its correct destination. Both the user accounts and messages were encrypted on a MySQL database so that the clients could log in and see previous messages.

Note: The MySQL Database connection information has been removed.
